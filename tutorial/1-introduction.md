# Datadog logs tutorial

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Hello and welcome!

In this tutorial we will learn how to setup an application from scratch and put this live using the existing tools available.

We will learn:
- [x] How to deploy an app in Kubernetes using Blops
- [x] How to setup the application to send logs for Datadog
- [x] How to query logs in Datadog
- [x] How to setup a dashboard using metrics collected from logs
- [x] How to setup alarms, so your team know when something goes awry

The application used for this tutorial is called `Loggen`. This is a NodeJS application created for demo purposes and basically generate logs periodically. You can find all the necessary information about the application checking [this README file](../README.md).

On the next chapter we will learn how to integrate this application with Blops and deploy in our K8s cluster.
